          Hello! Welcome to my personal website, quick tidbits about me, I'm passionate about web development. I've been part of various start ups and projects
          all pertaining to different fields. It's been a long journey of learning and getting to where I'm at currently, and I'm just getting started!
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy collaborating and discussing the latest tech as well as techniques with my peers around me. I'd like to consider myself to be a very laid back and open-minded person.
          I enjoy hearing how other people integrate and use technologies. Asking questions and not knowing something right away is all part of the learning experience for me and I highly enjoy it.
